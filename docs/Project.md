# Archyx AI - Heritage Archive Intelligence Platform

## Overview

Archyx AI is a sophisticated, AI-powered document management and chat interface platform designed specifically for the Heritage Square Foundation. It transforms the way heritage organizations interact with their digital archives by combining a familiar ChatGPT-style conversational interface with powerful archival and document organization capabilities, leveraging cutting-edge AI to make historical documents and heritage materials more accessible, searchable, and intelligently organized.

## Problem Statement

Heritage organizations like the Heritage Square Foundation face critical challenges in managing their digital archives:

### Document Management Challenges
